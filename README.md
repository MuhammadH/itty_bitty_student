# ib_private
The Itty Bitty model public repo. Earable data is not public.  
Careful - only use "python3 eval_only.py" so as not to overwrite the model. Different hardware/ software platforms can output different models.  
Running "python3 student.py" will train, evaluate, and save the student model.  
Running "python3 eval_only.py" will evaluate the student and provide a confusion matrix.
